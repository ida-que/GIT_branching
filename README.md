## GIT - homework 1 - GIT_init publishing with git init
This is a part of GIT homework 1. To see all the GIT homeworks, click [here](https://github.com/ida-que/GIT-homeworks).</br>
_Note: To work with GIT repos, I used some of these necessary tools:_
- _a GitHub account_
- _GitBash (for Windows) to write commands_
- _Git installed to operate Git repos_
- _folders for keeping local repos (I used `mkdir` Bash command to create those in terminal)_

After that, I had to set some preconditions to go to the first step of the scenario:
- creating a remote repo called _Git_branching_ in GitHub
- copying HTML link to the remote repo
- cloning this repo to the local directory with `git clone <HTML link to remote repo here>`

## STEPS
#### 1. In your local repository, make branches for:
- Postman
- Jmeter
- CheckLists
- Bug Reports
- SQL
- Charles
- Mobile testing
This step requires only one command `git branch`, using it 7 times to make 7 branches (example with _Postman_ branch below):
```

```
#### 2. Push all the branches to the remote repository.
#### 3. In _Bug Reports_ branch, create a text document with the structure of the bug report.
#### 4. Push the bug report structure to the remote repository.
#### . Merge _Bug Reports_ branch into _main_.
#### 6. Push _main_ to the remote repository.
#### 7. In the _CheckLists_ branch, create a document with checklist structure.
#### 8. Push this checklist structure to the remote repository.
#### 9. In the remote repository, do a pull request of _CheckLists_ branch into _main_.
#### 10. Synchronize remote and local main branches.
